AsyncButton offers a simple way to extend any type of button with an asynchronous aspect. It comes in two flavors that are independent (so no additional dependencies) of `builder` or `hook` pattern. Note, the hook version does rely on `flutter_hooks` for use. Either method allows adding loading, disabled, errored and completed states (with fluid animation between each) on top of buttons that perform asynchronous tasks.
